**Today's Progress**:

#### Find the Difference

Moving ahead in this Journey, Today I solve an easy-level string question on #leetcode  today. It was a fascinating dive into the world of string manipulation and bitwise operations. Let's break down the approach and insights gained from solving "Find the Difference."

🎯 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭:

You are given two strings s and t.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Return the letter that was added to t.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"

🛠️ Solution Explained:

Key Technique: The magic of XOR (^) operation in solving this puzzle is truly fascinating. Here’s how I approached it:

- XOR-ing String s: I started by initializing a character ch to 0. Then, I XOR-ed all characters in string s using a loop. The beauty of XOR is that it cancels out identical elements (i.e., a ^ a = 0).

- XOR-ing String t: Next, I XOR-ed all characters in string t, including the newly added character. Since XOR-ing an element twice cancels it out, all characters originally in s are neutralized, leaving behind the new character.

- Unveiling the Added Character: The final value of ch after all XOR operations is the character that was added to s to form t. It’s a clever use of bitwise manipulation to solve the problem efficiently.
<!-- **Thoughts**: Delving into these questions, I navigated through array manipulations, optimized for performance, and unlocked new strategies for dealing with matrix transformations. -->
