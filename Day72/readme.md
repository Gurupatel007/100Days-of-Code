# Problem Overviews

Today, I cracked two coding problems using the binary search method. The problems were "First Bad Version" and "Guess Number Higher or Lower." In both cases, binary search helped me find the solution faster.

## First Bad Version

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad. The challenge involves using a given API `isBadVersion(version)` to find the first bad version, minimizing the number of API calls.

## Guess Number Higher or Lower

In this game, a number is picked from 1 to n, and you must guess the number. After each incorrect guess, you're told whether the number is higher or lower than your guess. You must use the given API `guess(num)` to determine the correct number with as few guesses as possible.
