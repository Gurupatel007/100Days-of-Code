## Log

Here's where I'll keep a daily log of my progress, including what I learned, what I worked on, and any reflections or insights I've gained.

### Day 50: [01/03/2024]

**Today's Progress**:

Today isn't just another day in my coding journey; it's a major milestone! ðŸŽ¯ I've officially hit the halfway mark of the 100 Days of Code Challenge, and what a ride it's been so far! To make this day even more memorable, I dove into two intriguing problems on both LeetCode and Coding Ninjas. These problems tested my skills and pushed me to apply both fundamental and advanced coding strategies.

âœ…Two Sum (easy)
âœ…Sort Colors (Medium)

Reflecting on the past 50 days, I've experienced a tremendous amount of growth, not just in my coding abilities but also in my problem-solving skills and perseverance. Each challenge has taught me something new, and every problem solved has added a piece to the puzzle of my development journey.

But today is not only about looking back; it's also about looking forward. With 50 more days to go, I'm excited about the challenges ahead and the opportunities to learn and grow further. I'm committed to continuing this journey with the same zeal and enthusiasm that I started with.

<!-- **Thoughts**: Merge Sort is not just about sorting; it's about strategizing and efficiency. -->

# 100 Days Of Code

Welcome to my journey through the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge! This repository is a living document of my progress, insights, and the projects I'll be tackling over the next 100 days. My goal is to improve my coding skills by dedicating at least an hour every day to coding, learning new technologies, and working on projects.

## About the Challenge

The #100DaysOfCode challenge is a commitment to coding for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days. The goal is to build, experiment, and enhance coding skills by consistently working on projects and learning new concepts. This challenge encourages accountability, sharing progress with the community, and pushing boundaries to learn and grow as a developer.

## Goals

- **Improve Problem-Solving Skills**: Tackle a variety of coding problems to enhance my logical thinking and problem-solving capabilities.
- **Learn New Technologies**: Dedicate time to learning new languages, frameworks, and tools that are relevant to my interests and career goals.
- **Build Projects**: Apply what I learn by building projects. This includes small utility tools, contributing to open source, or even developing full-fledged applications.
- **Consistency**: Cultivate the habit of coding daily, which is crucial for long-term success in the tech industry.
