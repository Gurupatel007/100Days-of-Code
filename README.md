# 100 Days Of Code

Welcome to my journey through the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge! This repository is a living document of my progress, insights, and the projects I'll be tackling over the next 100 days. My goal is to improve my coding skills by dedicating at least an hour every day to coding, learning new technologies, and working on projects.

## About the Challenge

The #100DaysOfCode challenge is a commitment to coding for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days. The goal is to build, experiment, and enhance coding skills by consistently working on projects and learning new concepts. This challenge encourages accountability, sharing progress with the community, and pushing boundaries to learn and grow as a developer.

## Goals

- **Improve Problem-Solving Skills**: Tackle a variety of coding problems to enhance my logical thinking and problem-solving capabilities.
- **Learn New Technologies**: Dedicate time to learning new languages, frameworks, and tools that are relevant to my interests and career goals.
- **Build Projects**: Apply what I learn by building projects. This includes small utility tools, contributing to open source, or even developing full-fledged applications.
- **Consistency**: Cultivate the habit of coding daily, which is crucial for long-term success in the tech industry.
