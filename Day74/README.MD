Here's a combined README markdown file that includes a brief description of both problems and links to their individual README files.

# Binary Search Challenges

Today, I dove into two fascinating problems that showcased the power and efficiency of using binary search algorithms. Here's a brief overview of each:

## 1. Valid Perfect Square

This problem asks us to determine whether a given positive integer is a perfect square without using any built-in library functions. A perfect square is an integer that can be expressed as the product of some integer with itself.

## 2. Arranging Coins

In this challenge, we're given `n` coins and tasked with constructing a staircase where each row `i` contains exactly `i` coins. The goal is to find the total number of complete rows that can be formed with the given number of coins.

Both problems are solved using a binary search approach, which significantly reduces the time complexity compared to a linear search or brute force methods. Binary search allows us to cut the search space in half at each step, enabling us to quickly zero in on the solution.
