## Log

Here's where I'll keep a daily log of my progress, including what I learned, what I worked on, and any reflections or insights I've gained.

### Day 27: [07/02/2024]

**Today's Progress**:Hey all! Just wanted to share that I solved 7 coding problems today - 2 on LeetCode and 5 on Coding Ninjas. üöÄüìöüë®‚Äçüíª.

**Thoughts**: It felt awesome to figure them out and learn something new. It‚Äôs a small step, but every bit counts, right? üåü.
