1. **Single Element in a Sorted Array**: Given a sorted array where every element appears exactly twice except for one element which appears exactly once, find this single element. The solution must achieve O(log n) time complexity. Dive into the detailed solution and analysis [Here](SingleElement.md).

2. **Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array**: Identify the minimum element in a sorted array that has been rotated an unknown number of times. This problem tests your ability to adapt the binary search algorithm to a modified sorted array, requiring a solution within O(log n) time complexity. Explore the solution [Here](FindMinimum.md).
