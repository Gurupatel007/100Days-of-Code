## Log

Here's where I'll keep a daily log of my progress, including what I learned, what I worked on, and any reflections or insights I've gained.

### Day 56: [07/03/2024]

**Today's Progress**:

#### Majority Element

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡 & 𝐒𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:

- My approach to solving this problem involved using a HashMap to keep track of each element's frequency in the array.

- For every element in the array, I checked if it is already in the HashMap. If it is, I updated its count; otherwise, I added it to the map with a count of 1.

- After populating the HashMap, I iterated through the map to find the element with a count greater than ⌊n/2⌋. This element is our majority element.

- This method is straightforward and effective, providing a clear solution by leveraging the power of HashMaps to count and track the occurrences of each number in the array.

<!-- **Thoughts**: Delving into these questions, I navigated through array manipulations, optimized for performance, and unlocked new strategies for dealing with matrix transformations. -->

# 100 Days Of Code

Welcome to my journey through the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge! This repository is a living document of my progress, insights, and the projects I'll be tackling over the next 100 days. My goal is to improve my coding skills by dedicating at least an hour every day to coding, learning new technologies, and working on projects.

## About the Challenge

The #100DaysOfCode challenge is a commitment to coding for at least one hour every day for the next 100 days. The goal is to build, experiment, and enhance coding skills by consistently working on projects and learning new concepts. This challenge encourages accountability, sharing progress with the community, and pushing boundaries to learn and grow as a developer.

## Goals

- **Improve Problem-Solving Skills**: Tackle a variety of coding problems to enhance my logical thinking and problem-solving capabilities.
- **Learn New Technologies**: Dedicate time to learning new languages, frameworks, and tools that are relevant to my interests and career goals.
- **Build Projects**: Apply what I learn by building projects. This includes small utility tools, contributing to open source, or even developing full-fledged applications.
- **Consistency**: Cultivate the habit of coding daily, which is crucial for long-term success in the tech industry.
